1.  This header defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements, along with macros specifying their limits and macro functions to create values of these types.
2.  For the specific data , such as rgbtBlue, biSize, and bfType , They are different size. 
3.  BYTE = 8bit(1Byte), DWORD = 32bit(4Byte), LONG = 32bit(Byte), WORD = 16bit(2Byte).
4.  BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER
5.  One is WORD type , another is DWORD , which mean they have different size of data.
6.  The bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner, which also mean it's uncompressed file.
7.  biBitCount
8.  You may not have enough space in memory to store that pointer , or you don't have permission to access that file , or there is a existent file with same name , or that file is broken or missing while using it.
9.  Because we just use a size of BITMAPFILEHEADE, there is no need for a number more than one.
10. is 3
11. Skip over padding, if any
12. SEEK_CUR is a constant that is a current position of the file pointer.
